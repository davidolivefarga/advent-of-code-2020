# üå≤ Advent of Code 2020 üå≤

Solutions for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) puzzles, written in Javascript.

Every day two new puzzles are released, but you need to solve the first to unlock the second. Each puzzle grants a star, so the objective is to get all 50 stars. My aim is to code efficient solutions and comment them so that they can be easily understood.

Thanks [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) for organising this event!

## Project structure

Every day has its own folder with the following files:

- `input.js`: the puzzles input, formatted in a suitable way to solve them
- `puzzle1-solution.js`: the solution to the first puzzle
- `puzzle2-solution.js`: the solution to the second puzzle
- `README.md`: the explanation of each solution

To run any solution, you can use Node:

```sh
# Runs the solution of the first puzzle of Day 1
node day1/puzzle1-solution
```

Here's the list of all days, along with the stars obtained in each of them.
